;;; Commentary:
;;    My personal configuration for GNU Emacs.

;;; Code:

(require 'use-package)

;; Set a path to a custom file
(setq custom-file (concat user-emacs-directory "custom.el"))

(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))

;; Set a font
(defvar common/font
  (cond ((eq system-type 'darwin)     '(:family "Monaco" :height 140))
	((eq system-type 'windows-nt) '(:family "Consolas" :height 140))
	(t                            '(:family "JetBrains Mono" :height 140)))
  "Default font")

(defun common/set-font ()
  "A function to set a font for current OS."
  (apply 'set-face-attribute 'default nil common/font)
  (if (eq system-type 'windows-nt)
      (setq w32-use-visible-system-caret nil)))

;; Set up the GNU Emacs
(use-package emacs
  :config
  (common/set-font))

(provide 'init)
